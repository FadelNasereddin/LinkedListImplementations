# LinkedListImplementations
A Linked List creator used to visualize &amp; manipulate Linked Lists 

I decided to create a Java Application to ceate & Manipulate LinkedLists. The source code was written from scratch instead of using the Java collections API. Below is an explanation of the methodology;

# Classes:
- Node Class
- LinekdList Class
- Main Class

# Methods:
- Insert(): Allows you to create a new node with properties data and next 
- InsertAt(): Allows you to insert a new node at a specific location in the LinkedList by manipulating with the pointers
- InsertAtStart(): Allows you to insert a new head node
- Show(): Prints out elements in the linkedlsit 

# Functions:
- reverseLinkedLiset(): Reverses the Linkedlist
- countNodes: Returns total count of nodes in the LinkedList
